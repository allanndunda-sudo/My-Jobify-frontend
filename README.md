Job Finder App
The Job Finder App is a simple yet powerful web application built with React.
 It helps job seekers connect with companies by matching people to opportunities based on their profession, skills, and qualifications.
Job seekers can create profiles, search for jobs, and apply directly through the platform.
 Employers, on the other hand, can post openings, review applications, and find candidates who best fit their roles — all from one easy-to-use dashboard.
Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate how a frontend (built with React) and a backend (powered by JSON Server) can work together to create a functional, user-driven platform.
The main goal is to build a clean, responsive, and interactive job-matching system that focuses on real-world functionality while keeping the implementation lightweight and easy to understand.
Once complete, the app will be deployed publicly using Vercel, making it accessible to anyone online.
